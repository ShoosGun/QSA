# Sockets-In-OWA
### A project that aims to add socket connections to the game Outer Wilds Alpha

Fell free to look and even help with this project, the big part of handling connections is already done, and there is even some prototypes of the player movement system. 
All the sockets stuff was learned from / inspired by these series from [CaptJiggly](https://www.youtube.com/c/CaptJiggly): [multi connection server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHq2lYLA4XY) and 
[packet IO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFM0EZLE9MM&list=PLLITw-6k1t1YpH5vPPIYCKfNfLRlY_jme)

* The Server Side part works as any other [DIMOWA](https://github.com/ShoosGun/DIMOWA)'s mod, so just place it in the `mods` folder and install it
  *  Your firewall might not be triggered by it because it only allows connections made inside the computer of the host

* Totally not copying the idea from, [QSB](https://github.com/misternebula/quantum-space-buddies), why would I *ever* do that
